# Template module

This module provides a template to create new modules with remote state and locking pre-configured.

Once a new module is configured, the setup.tf and the templates folder will be deleted.

A terraform.tf file will be created to handle remote state configuration.

Use the create.sh script in the root folder of the project to generate a new module based on this template.
